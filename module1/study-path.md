# ☁️ Cloud Speedrun Path for Developers (JS + Node.js → DevOps & Cloud Engineer)

## 🎯 Goal

Master the fundamentals of cloud (starting with Microsoft Entra + Azure) and pivot your coding skills into real DevOps and cloud automation power—fast.

---

## 🗓️ 4-Week Cloud Mastery Plan

### **Week 1: Foundation – Identity & Access (Microsoft Entra)**

**Objective:** Understand authentication, authorization, and governance in cloud environments.

- 🧠 Study:
  - [Microsoft Learn: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Entra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/entra/)
  - [Coursera: Getting Started with Microsoft Entra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-microsoft-entra)
- 💻 Practice:
  - Create a free [Microsoft Entra tenant](https://entra.microsoft.com)
  - Add users, assign roles, test MFA and Conditional Access
- ⚙️ Automate:
  - Use **Node.js** with Microsoft Graph API to manage users programmatically.
- ✅ Outcome:
  - Know tenants, directories, RBAC, groups, licensing, and automation via API.

---

### **Week 2: Core Azure Concepts**

**Objective:** Build a mental map of Azure’s architecture.

- 🧠 Study:
  - [Microsoft Learn: Azure Fundamentals learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
  - Understand compute, storage, networking, and identity basics.
- 💻 Practice:
  - Create free-tier VMs, blob storage, and resource groups.
  - Experiment with **Azure CLI** (learn basic commands).
- ⚙️ Automate:
  - Use **YAML** or **Bicep** templates to deploy a resource.
  - Trigger a small deployment with a Node.js script calling Azure REST API.
- ✅ Outcome:
  - Understand what each Azure service does and how they connect.

---

### **Week 3: DevOps Automation & CI/CD**

**Objective:** Learn how to integrate automation pipelines using tools you already know.

- 🧠 Study:
  - [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
  - [Azure DevOps Pipelines Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/)
- 💻 Practice:
  - Create a GitHub repo with a YAML-based CI/CD workflow.
  - Build → Test → Deploy a simple Node.js app automatically.
- ⚙️ Add-On Skills:
  - Learn Docker fundamentals (containers make cloud easy to move).
  - Practice writing your own Dockerfile for your Node.js app.
- ✅ Outcome:
  - Build and deploy automation pipelines with ease.

---

### **Week 4: Cloud Security & Real-World Projects**

**Objective:** Bring it all together and create a showcase project.

- 🧠 Study:
  - [Microsoft Learn: Secure your cloud data and infrastructure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/secure-cloud/)
  - Learn about identity protection, logging, and governance.
- 💻 Practice:
  - Integrate your Node.js project with Entra ID authentication.
  - Create a dashboard that displays users, groups, and login events using Microsoft Graph API.
- 🚀 Portfolio Project:
  - “**Cloud Identity Automation Dashboard**” — Node.js app that connects to Entra, manages users, and logs events.
- ✅ Outcome:
  - Real cloud automation project for your DevOps portfolio.

## ⚔️ Mindset Notes (Sukuna Mode)

- Don’t “study” cloud — **build** in it.
- Every concept should end with code or automation.
- Your goal isn’t certification; it’s **proof of mastery through creation**.
- Let frustration fuel your evolution — not cage it.

---

## 🏁 End Goal

By the end of this roadmap, you’ll be able to:

- Architect, automate, and deploy resources in Azure.
- Use Entra + Graph API for secure identity automation.
- Build CI/CD pipelines for Node.js apps.
- Be cloud-ready for DevOps and platform engineer roles.
